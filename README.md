# This is the Final Project of IS601
  Copied project 3 code and created a new project in Pycharm.
  Edited the project 3 code followed by the tutorial.
  Merged each part to the master branch with total 11 branches.
    
# Content of the Project
  According to the tutorial provided by Professor, I added few new pages to the orginal project (based on project 3) 
  including sign up form, rendering the pages, set up config.py and other new techology I learnt from the tutorial.

# Program language
  Most of the part I only use PycharmPro as the IED, which also inclue MySql to interprete the data in db file. Also, need to 
  set its own interpretor and configuration.
